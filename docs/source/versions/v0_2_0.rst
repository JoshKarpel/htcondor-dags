v0.2.0

.. py:currentmodule:: htcondor_dags

New Features
------------

* You can now walk over all of the ancestors of a node
  (i.e., its parents, the parents of its parents, the parents of parents of
  its parents, etc.) using :meth:`~BaseNode.walk_ancestors`,
  and similarly for its descendants using :meth:`~BaseNode.walk_descendants`.
* Implemented a new :class:`~Grouper` edge. It allows flexible "chunking" of the
  parent and child layers. For example, every three nodes in the parent layer can
  be connected to every two nodes in the child layer.
* Custom edges can now be created by implementing the :class:`~BaseEdge` interface.
* ``NOOP`` and ``DONE`` can now be set on individual nodes inside a layer.
  In addition to being a single boolean value, the corresponding :class:`~NodeLayer`
  attributes can now be set to a dictionary mapping node indices to a boolean.
  Missing indices are assumed to be ``False``
  For example, if node index 5 is not present in the ``noop`` dictionary, it is not ``NOOP``.
  It is only ``NOOP`` if it is present and its value is ``True``.
* The submit description for a :class:`~NodeLayer` can be given as a path to an
  existing HTCondor submit file.
* State information from previous DAGMan runs, encoded in a DAGMan "rescue" file,
  can now be loaded and laid over an existing :class:`~DAG` using the new
  :func:`~rescue` function.
