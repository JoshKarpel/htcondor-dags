v0.2.0
======

New Features
------------

* You can now walk over all of the ancestors of a node
  (i.e., its parents, the parents of its parents, the parents of parents of
  its parents, etc.) using :meth:`BaseNode.walk_ancestors`,
  and similarly for its descendants using :meth:`BaseNode.walk_descendants`.
* Implemented a new :class:`Grouper` edge. It allows flexible "chunking" of the
  parent and child layers. For example, every three nodes in the parent layer can
  be connected to every two nodes in the child layer.
* Custom edges can now be created by implementing the :class:`BaseEdge` interface.
* ``NOOP`` and ``DONE`` can now be set on individual nodes inside a layer.
  In addition to being a single boolean value, the corresponding :class:`NodeLayer`
  attributes can now be set to a dictionary mapping node indices to a boolean.
  Missing indices are assumed to be ``False``
  For example, if node index 5 is not present in the ``noop`` dictionary, it is not ``NOOP``.
  It is only ``NOOP`` if it is present and its value is ``True``.
